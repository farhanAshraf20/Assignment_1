/******************************************************************
Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of Rs.50 and you have to add some more amount to it. Create a class 'AddAmount' with a data member named 'amount' with an initial value of Rs. 50. Now make two constructors of this class as follows:
1 - without any parameter - no amount will be added to the Piggie Bank
2 - having a parameter which is the amount that will be added to the Piggie Bank
Create an object of the 'AddAmount' class and display the final amount in the Piggie Bank.
